Function

   Predicts transmembrance topology and signal peptides using Phobius

Description

   kphobius predicts transmembrance topology and signal peptides from
   the amino acid sequence of a protein utilizing Phobius.
   Phobius predicts a combined protein topolgy and signal peptide. The
   predictor is based on a hidden Markovmodel (HMM) that models the
   different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions
   of a transmembrane protein in a series ofinterconnected states.

   kphobius utilizes Phobius SOAP service provided by EBI (European Bioinformatics
   Institute). Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/phobius/

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package, which
   contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy server at
   Keio University. kphobius is thus an interface of "runPhobius" method included in
   KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages as SOAP
   web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
