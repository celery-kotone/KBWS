Function

   
   Phylogenies from distance matrix by N-J or UPGMA method using neighbor


Description

   kneighbor is phylogenies from distance matrix by N-J or UPGMA method
   utilizing "neighbor" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fneighbor included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     An implementation by Mary Kuhner and John Yamato of Saitou and Nei's
     "Neighbor Joining Method," and of the UPGMA (Average Linkage
     clustering) method. Neighbor Joining is a distance matrix method
     producing an unrooted tree without the assumption of a clock. UPGMA
     does assume a clock. The branch lengths are not optimized by the least
     squares criterion but the methods are very fast and thus can handle
     much larger data sets.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/neighbor.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kneighboris thus an interface of "runNeighbor"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
