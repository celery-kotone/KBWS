Function

   
   DNA compatibility algorithm using dnacomp


Description

   kdnacomp is dNA compatibility algorithm
   utilizing "dnacomp" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnacomp included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from nucleic acid sequence data using the
     compatibility criterion, which searches for the largest number of
     sites which could have all states (nucleotides) uniquely evolved on
     the same tree. Compatibility is particularly appropriate when sites
     vary greatly in their rates of evolution, but we do not know in
     advance which are the less reliable ones.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnacomp.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnacompis thus an interface of "runDnacomp"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

DNA compatibility algorithm, version 3.57c


One most parsimonious tree found:




        +--Beta      
     +--3  
  +--2  +--Gamma     
  !  !  
--1  +-----Epsilon   
  !  
  +--------Delta     

  remember: this is an unrooted tree!


total number of compatible sites is       15.0
