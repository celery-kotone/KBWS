Function

   
   Compute genetic distances from gene frequencies using gendist


Description

   kgendist is compute genetic distances from gene frequencies
   utilizing "gendist" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fgendist included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Computes one of three different genetic distance formulas from gene
     frequency data. The formulas are Nei's genetic distance, the
     Cavalli-Sforza chord measure, and the genetic distance of Reynolds et.
     al. The former is appropriate for data in which new mutations occur in
     an infinite isoalleles neutral mutation model, the latter two for a
     model without mutation and with pure genetic drift. The distances are
     written to a file in a format appropriate for input to the distance
     matrix programs.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/gendist.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kgendistis thus an interface of "runGendist"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
