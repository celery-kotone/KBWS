Function

   
   Mixed parsimony algorithm using mix


Description

   kmix is mixed parsimony algorithm
   utilizing "mix" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fmix included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies by some parsimony methods for discrete character
     data with two states (0 and 1). Allows use of the Wagner parsimony
     method, the Camin-Sokal parsimony method, or arbitrary mixtures of
     these. Also reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting of
     characters (does not infer branch lengths).
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/mix.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kmixis thus an interface of "runMix"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
