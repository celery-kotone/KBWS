Function

   
   Protein distance algorithm using protdist


Description

   kprotdist is protein distance algorithm
   utilizing "protdist" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fprotdist included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Computes a distance measure for protein sequences, using maximum
     likelihood estimates based on the Dayhoff PAM matrix, the JTT matrix
     model, the PBM model, Kimura's 1983 approximation to these, or a model
     based on the genetic code plus a constraint on changing to a different
     category of amino acid. The distances can also be corrected for
     gamma-distributed and gamma-plus-invariant-sites-distributed rates of
     change in different sites. Rates of evolution can vary among sites in
     a prespecified way, and also according to a Hidden Markov model. The
     program can also make a table of percentage similarity among
     sequences. The distances can be used in the distance matrix programs.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/protdist.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kprotdist is thus an interface of "runProtdist"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
