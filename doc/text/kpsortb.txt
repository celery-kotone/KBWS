Function

   Predicts protein localization for PSORTB

Description

   kpsortb predicts protein localization sites utilizing PSORTb.

   PSORTb analyzes the subcellular localization of proteins from
   amino acid sequence. PSORTb consists of multiple analytical
   modules and classifying a protein as either belonging or not
   belonging to a particular localization site for various sequence
   features.

   kpsortb utilizes PSORT WWW Server provided by www.psort.org. This
   service is based on PSORTb v.2.0. PSORTb v.2.0 is updated from
   PSORT-B v.1.1. Differences between those include "updated several
   algorithms", "utilizing a probabilistic system" and etc.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.psort.org/psortb/

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kpsortb is thus an interface of "runPsortb"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming
   languages as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
