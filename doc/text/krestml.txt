Function

   
   Restriction site maximum Likelihood method using restml


Description

   krestml is restriction site maximum Likelihood method
   utilizing "restml" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from frestml included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimation of phylogenies by maximum likelihood using restriction
     sites data (not restriction fragments but presence/absence of
     individual sites). It employs the Jukes-Cantor symmetrical model of
     nucleotide change, which does not allow for differences of rate
     between transitions and transversions. This program is very slow.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/restml.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. krestml is thus an interface of "runRestml"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
