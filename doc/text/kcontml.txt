Function

   
   Gene frequency and continuous character Maximum Likelihood using contml


Description

   kcontml is gene frequency and continuous character Maximum Likelihood
   utilizing "contml" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fcontml included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from gene frequency data by maximum likelihood
     under a model in which all divergence is due to genetic drift in the
     absence of new mutations. Does not assume a molecular clock. An
     alternative method of analyzing this data is to compute Nei's genetic
     distance and use one of the distance matrix programs. This program can
     also do maximum likelihood analysis of continuous characters that
     evolve by a Brownian Motion model, but it assumes that the characters
     evolve at equal rates and in an uncorrelated fashion, so that it does
     not take into account the usual correlations of characters.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/contml.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kcontml is thus an interface of "runContml"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
