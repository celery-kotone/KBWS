Function

   
   Fitch-Margoliash method with contemporary tips using kitsch


Description

   kkitsch is fitch-Margoliash method with contemporary tips
   utilizing "kitsch" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fkitsch included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from distance matrix data under the
     "ultrametric" model which is the same as the additive tree model
     except that an evolutionary clock is assumed. The Fitch-Margoliash
     criterion and other least squares criteria, or the Minimum Evolution
     criterion are possible. This program will be useful with distances
     computed from molecular sequences, restriction sites or fragments
     distances, with distances from DNA hybridization measurements, and
     with genetic distances computed from gene frequencies.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/kitsch.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kkitsch is thus an interface of "runKitsch"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
