Function

   
   Estimates nucleotide phylogeny by maximum likelihood using dnaml


Description

   kdnaml is estimates nucleotide phylogeny by maximum likelihood
   utilizing "dnaml" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnaml included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from nucleotide sequences by maximum likelihood.
     The model employed allows for unequal expected frequencies of the four
     nucleotides, for unequal rates of transitions and transversions, and
     for different (prespecified) rates of change in different categories
     of sites, and also use of a Hidden Markov model of rates, with the
     program inferring which sites have which rates. This also allows
     gamma-distribution and gamma-plus-invariant sites distributions of
     rates across sites.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnaml.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnamlis thus an interface of "runDnaml"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
