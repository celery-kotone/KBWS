Function

   
   Mapping experimental data on PathwayProjector


Description

   kpathwayprojector maps experimental data, such as transcriptomics,
   proteomics or metabolomics on Pathway Projector.

   Pathway Projector provides integrated pathway maps that are based upon
   the KEGG Atlas, with the addition of nodes for genes and enzymes, and
   is implemented as a scalable, zoomable map. Users can search pathway-related
   data using keywords, molecular weights, nucleotide sequences, and amino
   acid sequences, or as possible routes between compounds. In addition,
   experimental data from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses
   can be readily mapped.

   Pathway Projector is provided by Institute for Advanced Biosciences.
   Original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/PathwayProjector/

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kprotpars is thus an interface of "map2PathwayProjector"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
