Function

   
   Fitch-Margoliash and Least-Squares Distance Methods using fitch


Description

   kfitch is fitch-Margoliash and Least-Squares Distance Methods
   utilizing "fitch" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from ffitch included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from distance matrix data under the "additive
     tree model" according to which the distances are expected to equal the
     sums of branch lengths between the species. Uses the Fitch-Margoliash
     criterion and some related least squares criteria, or the Minimum
     Evolution distance matrix method. Does not assume an evolutionary
     clock. This program will be useful with distances computed from
     molecular sequences, restriction sites or fragments distances, with
     DNA hybridization measurements, and with genetic distances computed
     from gene frequencies.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/fitch.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kfitchis thus an interface of "runFitch"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
