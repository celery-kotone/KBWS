Function

   Generation of sequence logos using WebLogo

Description

   kweblogo is a sequence logo generator utilizing  WebLogo.
   WebLogo is a web based application designed to make the
   generation of sequence logos as easy and painless as possible.
   Sequence Logos are a graphical representation of an amino acid
   or nucleic acid multiple sequence alignment developed
   by Tom Schneider and Mike Stephens.

   kweblogo utilizing WebLogo web service provided by University of
   California, Berkeley. Original web-service is located at the following
   URL:

   http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kweblogo is thus an interface of "runWeblogo"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://www.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
