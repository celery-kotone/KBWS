Function

   
   Nucleic acid sequence Invariants method using dnainvar


Description

   kdnainvar is nucleic acid sequence Invariants method
   utilizing "dnainvar" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnainvar included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     For nucleic acid sequence data on four species, computes Lake's and
     Cavender's phylogenetic invariants, which test alternative tree
     topologies. The program also tabulates the frequencies of occurrence
     of the different nucleotide patterns. Lake's invariants are the method
     which he calls "evolutionary parsimony".
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnainvar.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnainvar is thus an interface of "runDnainvar"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

Tree topologies (unrooted):

   II:  ((Delta,Gamma),(Epsilon,Beta))
  III:  ((Delta,Beta),(Epsilon,Gamma))


Lake's linear invariants
 (these are expected to be zero for the two incorrect tree topologies.
  This is tested by testing the equality of the two parts
  of each expression using a one-sided exact binomial test.
  The null hypothesis is that the first part is no larger than the second.)

 Tree                             Exact test P value    Significant?

   I      1    -     1   =     0       0.7500               no
   II     1    -     0   =     1       0.5000               no
   III    0    -     0   =     0       1.0000               no


Cavender's quadratic invariants (type L) using purines vs. pyrimidines
 (these are expected to be zero, and thus have a nonsignificant
  chi-square, for the correct tree topology)
They will be misled if there are substantially
different evolutionary rate between sites, or
different purine:pyrimidine ratios from 1:1.

  Tree I:

   Contingency Table

      6     2
      0     3

   Quadratic invariant =           -18.0

   Chi-square =    4.95000 (P < 0.05)


  Tree II:

   Contingency Table

      5     2
      0     4

   Quadratic invariant =           -20.0

   Chi-square =    5.23810 (P < 0.05)


  Tree III:

   Contingency Table

      5     0
      2     4

   Quadratic invariant =           -20.0

   Chi-square =    5.23810 (P < 0.05)




Cavender's quadratic invariants (type K) using purines vs. pyrimidines
 (these are expected to be zero for the correct tree topology)
They will be misled if there are substantially
different evolutionary rate between sites, or
different purine:pyrimidine ratios from 1:1.
No statistical test is done on them here.

  Tree I:               0.0
  Tree II:             -2.0
  Tree III:             2.0
