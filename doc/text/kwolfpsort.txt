Function

   Predicts protein localization for WoLF PSORT

Description

   kwolfpsort predicts the subcellular localization sites of proteins
   based on their amino acid sequences utilizing WoLF PSORT.
   WoLF PSORT is a mafor extension to the PSORT II program, and makes
   predictions based on both known sorting signal motifs and some
   correlative sequene features such as amino acid content.

   kwolfpsort utilize WoLF PSORT web service provided by PSORT WWW Server.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://wolfpsort.org/

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kwolfpsort is thus an interface of "runWolfPsort"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
