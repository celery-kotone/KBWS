Function

   
   Protein parsimony algorithm using protpars


Description

   kprotpars is protein parsimony algorithm
   utilizing "protpars" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fprotpars included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies from protein sequences (input using the standard
     one-letter code for amino acids) using the parsimony method, in a
     variant which counts only those nucleotide changes that change the
     amino acid, on the assumption that silent changes are more easily
     accomplished.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/protpars.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kprotpars is thus an interface of "runProtpars"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
