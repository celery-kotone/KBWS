Function

   
   Penny algorithm, branch-and-bound using penny


Description

   kpenny is penny algorithm, branch-and-bound
   utilizing "penny" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fpenny included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character data
     with two states, for the Wagner, Camin-Sokal, and mixed parsimony
     criteria using the branch-and-bound method of exact search. May be
     impractical (depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/penny.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kpennyis thus an interface of "runPenny"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
