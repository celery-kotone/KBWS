Function

   
   Nucleic acid sequence Distance Matrix program using dnadist


Description

   kdnadist is nucleic acid sequence Distance Matrix program
   utilizing "dnadist" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnadist included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Computes four different distances between species from nucleic acid
     sequences. The distances can then be used in the distance matrix
     programs. The distances are the Jukes-Cantor formula, one based on
     Kimura's 2- parameter method, the F84 model used in DNAML, and the
     LogDet distance. The distances can also be corrected for
     gamma-distributed and gamma-plus-invariant-sites-distributed rates of
     change in different sites. Rates of evolution can vary among sites in
     a prespecified way, and also according to a Hidden Markov model. The
     program can also make a table of percentage similarity among
     sequences.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnadist.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnadistis thus an interface of "runDnadist"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
