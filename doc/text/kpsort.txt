Function

   Predicts protein localization for PSORT

Description

   kpsort predicts protein localization sites utilizing PSORT.

   PSORT analyzes the input sequence by applying the stored rules
   for various sequence features of known protein sorting signals
   and reports the possiblity for the input protein to be localized
   at each candidate site with additional information.

   kpsort utilizes PSORT WWW Server provided by Tokyo University.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kpsort is thus an interface of "runPsort"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
