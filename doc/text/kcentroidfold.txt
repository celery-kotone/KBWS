Function

   Predicts RNA 2D structure using CentroidFold

Description

   kcentroidfold predicts an RNA 2D structure from given RNA sequence
   utilizing CentroidFold.
   CentroidFold is based on the gamma-centroid estimator for high-dimensional
   discrete spaces.

   kcentroidfold utilizes CentroidFold Web Server provided by ncRNA.org.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.ncrna.org/centroidfold/

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kcentroidfold is thus an interface of "runCentroidFold"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     (Gapped) sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-outseq]            outfile    [.kcentroidfold] CentroidFold Seq/Fold
                                  output filename

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -model              string     specify "CONTRAfold" or "McCaskill"
                                  about using model (default "CONTRAfold")
   -gamma              integer    weight of base pairs (2^-5 ~ 2^10)
                                  default "1024"

Input file format

  kcentroidfold can use any genome sequence data that seqret can read.

Output file format

   kcentroidfold outputs "Seq/Fold information" and "graph result".
   "Seq/Fold information" is general CentroidFold output file.
   "graph result" is an URL about image file of predicted 2D structure.
