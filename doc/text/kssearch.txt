Function

   Search similar sequences in public repositories using SSEARCH

Description

   kssearch compares query sequences with databases utilizing SSEARCH
   (Smith-Waterman Search).
   SSEARCH does a rigorous Smith-Waterman search for similarity between
   a query sequence and a group of sequences of the same type (nucleid acid
   or protein).

   kssearch utilizes SSEARCH method included in FASTA SOAP service provided
   by EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute).Original web-service is located
   at the following URL:

   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/sss/fasta_rest

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kssearch is an interface of "runSSearch" method
   included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with kssearch

% kssearch
compares query sequences to databases using SSEARCH
Input (gapped) sequence(s): test.fasta
database for search: uniprotkb
output sequence(s) [nc_000908.kssearch]:
Jobid: kbws_5626576


   ### output sample
