Function

   
   Dollo and polymorphism parsimony algorithm using dollop


Description

   kdollop is dollo and polymorphism parsimony algorithm
   utilizing "dollop" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdollop included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies by the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony criteria
     for discrete character data with two states (0 and 1). Also
     reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting of characters.
     Dollo parsimony is particularly appropriate for restriction sites
     data; with ancestor states specified as unknown it may be appropriate
     for restriction fragments data.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dollop.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdollopis thus an interface of "runDollop"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
