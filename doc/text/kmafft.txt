Function

   Multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT

Description

   kmafft calculates the multiple sequence alignment utilizing MAFFT.
   MAFFT has various multiple sequence alignment. They are classified
   to three types, the progressive method, the iterative refinement
   method with the WSP score, and the iterative refinement method using
   both the WSP and consistency score.

   kmafft utilizes MAFFT version 6 Online version provided by Kyushu Univ.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/index.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS)
   package, which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services
   through a proxy server at Keio University. kmafft is thus an
   interface of "runMafft" method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming
   languages as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online
   documentations http://www.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.
