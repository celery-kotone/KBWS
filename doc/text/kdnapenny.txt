Function

   
   Penny algorithm for DNA using dnapenny


Description

   kdnapenny is penny algorithm for DNA
   utilizing "dnapenny" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnapenny included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for nucleic acid sequences by
     branch-and-bound search. This may not be practical (depending on the
     data) for more than 10-11 species or so.
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnapenny.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnapennyis thus an interface of "runDnapenny"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

Penny algorithm for DNA, version 3.57c
 branch-and-bound to find all most parsimonious trees



requires a total of             16.000

One most parsimonious tree found:




  +--------Delta     
  !  
--1     +--Beta      
  !  +--2  
  +--3  +--Gamma     
     !  
     +-----Epsilon   

  remember: this is an unrooted tree!
