Function

   
   DNA parsimony algorithm using dnapars


Description

   kdnapars is dNA parsimony algorithm
   utilizing "dnapars" methods provided in PHYLIP web service.

   Following block is a quotation from fdnapars included in PHYLIPNEW
   package.
     
     Estimates phylogenies by the parsimony method using nucleic acid
     sequences. Allows use the full IUB ambiguity codes, and estimates
     ancestral nucleotide states. Gaps treated as a fifth nucleotide state.
     It can also fo transversion parsimony. Can cope with multifurcations,
     reconstruct ancestral states, use 0/1 character weights, and infer
     branch lengths
  
   PHYLIP web service is provided by National University of Singapore.
   Original web-service is located at the following URL:

   http://bioportal.bic.nus.edu.sg/phylip/dnapars.html

   This tools is a subset of Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS) package,
   which contains interfaces to bioinformatics web services through a proxy
   server at Keio University. kdnaparsis thus an interface of "runDnapars"
   method included in KBWS SOAP service.
   This method can be alternatively accessed directly from programming languages
   as SOAP web service. Please refer to the KBWS online documentations
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/ for more information.

DNA parsimony algorithm, version 3.57c


One most parsimonious tree found:




        +--Beta      
     +--3  
  +--2  +--Gamma
